            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Apelings are a fusion of human and monkey traits. Their fur, 5 feet long tails, ape faces, and most other physical characteristics suggest monkey and thus they are closer to primate than man. However, their intelligence, larger size, and more bipedal posture suggest the influence of human traits. Apelings are closer to the size of a small human yet their strength is more comparable to an orc or dwarf than human. They usually have more defined muscles than monkeys although they are still rather slender, keeping a very athletic appearance. Fur colours range from common black and brown to the more exotic colours such as pink or green. White fur is usually a "sign" of inherent greatness. Apelings age fast, reaching full adulthood in only 12 years. Although apelings only have a slightly longer lifespan than humans, their active nature and lifestyle mean they burn through their years faster than a human, putting their average lifespan at 100 years. Few careful and quieter apelings may live to see 150 and usually hold roles as tribal leaders and chiefs. Despite ageing fast, apelings do not feel the usual effects of old age until months before their death, many still adventuring within the last year of their life.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Apelings are direct descendants from a long forgotten Monkey God. This God was extremely joyful and filled with pride, but was one day challenged by an unknown villain. This challenge would see the disappearance of the Monkey God, but an influx in similar lesser creatures known now as Apelings.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Apelings are extremely confident, headstrong, and upbeat. Their boastful presence might dismay common folk and be found disrespectful by upper class citizens, however; apelings hold a firm loyalty to those who have proven themselves. Apelings usually live in small, closely held tribal communities. Entire nations or cities of apelings are few and far apart. Leadership roles are often held either by the elders or by the most personally accomplished, however, leaders generally don't have much power as many apelings prefer group decisions over the decisions of one individual. In the traditional sense, apelings do not have "families" and usually have an "all kin are family" mentality. Apelings found outside the normal communities either from being banished or simply wanderlust have an easy time adjusting to the "easy" life of cities. Finding work in such places comes easy due to the general truthfulness and raw strength of the race. Though work as teachers in any form meets a swift end, due to a simple disinterest in treading the same old beaten path. Dwarfs and Apelings get along great establishing trades of not only goods but physical feats. Though the boastful attitude Apelings have can be off-putting, Dwarves have long since grown fond of their attitude. Apelings still have trouble distinguishing male and female dwarves. Through their time with the dwarves, Apelings have adopted similar feelings towards elves. Though contact with elves remain oddly scarce. Most apeling adventurers tend to be more independent than their kin at home, but still hold on a lot to their sense of family and loyalty. Naturally energetic and overtly eager, spending their time standing still is against their nature.</p>
            <h4>APELING NAMES</h4>
            <p>Apelings originate from a more oriental part of the world, so while they share similar names to that of humans they are normally of the oriental variety.</p>
